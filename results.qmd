## Results

### Participant Characteristics
A total of 336 participants enrolled in our study and provided at least one month of data. [@tbl-demo] presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of these participants.

### Adherence

#### Participation
A total of 336 participants enrolled in our study and provided at least one month of EMA data. @fig-1 shows participant attrition over 12 months. There was no significant difference in attrition between participants who were Non-Hispanic White and participants who were not White. There was no significant difference in attrition between participants who lapsed on study and those who did not lapse.

#### Daily and Monthly Updates
The overall adherence for the daily updates was 75%. @fig-2 shows the overall adherence rates for the daily update by month on study. Daily update adherence did not significantly differ by race. Daily update adherence did significantly differ by whether someone lapsed on study. Participants who lapsed on study, had on average 6.4% lower compliance compared to participants who did not lapse while on study. The overall adherence for the monthly updates was 96%.

### Participant Experience Questionannaire Quantitative Results
247 participants provided at least four months of data and completed the participant experience questionnaire. These participants were included in following analyses.


#### Interference
84% of participants (N = 207/247) disagreed (i.e., endorsing "Strongly disagree" or "Mildly disagree") with the statement "Completing the daily update interfered with my daily activities". 79% of participants (N = 196/247) disagreed with the statement "Completing the monthly update interfered with my daily activities". We provide histograms of participant responses in the supplement.   

An ICC (type 3) showed that, on average, interference ratings were moderately consistent across the two updates, ICC = .50, 95% CI = [.40 - .59].


#### Dislike
85% of participants (N = 211/247) disagreed with the statement "I disliked completing the daily update". 73% of participants (N = 179/246) disagreed with the statement "I disliked completing the monthly update". Fewer participants disagreed with the statement "I disliked [sensing method]" for geolocation (65%; N = 161/247), SMS and phone logs (64%; N = 158/246), and SMS content (64%; N = 156/245). As a result we saw an increase in responses endorsing a neutral stance toward these passive sensing methods ("Agree and disagree equally"). We provide histograms of participant responses by sensing method in the supplement.   

An ICC (type 3) showed that, on average, dislike ratings were moderately consistent across sensing methods, ICC = .48, 95% CI = [.42 - .54].
